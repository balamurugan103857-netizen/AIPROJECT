Face Detection Models Required

The face-api.js library requires pre-trained model files to work.
These files should be placed in this directory (public/models/).

Required model files:
1. tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
2. tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
3. face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
4. face_landmark_68_model-shard1
5. face_recognition_model-weights_manifest.json
6. face_recognition_model-shard1
7. face_recognition_model-shard2

You can download these from:
https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights

Or run this script to download them automatically:
npm run download-models
